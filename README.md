The project deals with an website where we will be connecting NGO's of all over India  with our site in order to reduce food wastage .The idea behind the project is that daily lots of extra food get wasted in hotels, restaurants and wedding. So we are creating a website through  which if any amount of food get leftover in any hotel, restaurant or  wedding in any particular city then they will use our website to register details of leftover food, address then all NGO's of that city get notified about these details immediately. Afterwards the selected NGO can track down the location of leftover food and will distribute to poor people who do not have enough food to eat and are undernourished and malnourished.
